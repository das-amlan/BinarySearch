# BinarySearch
Binary search is a fast search algorithm. It has a run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n). 
This search algorithm follows the principle of divide and conquer. 

Binary search start it's search for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. 
If it matches, then the index of item is returned. 
If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. 
Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item
